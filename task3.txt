#in this script we call wages, cut the first two lines and grep to just get each specific years of college.
#after this, we sort and take the lowest or minimum wage and cut again to just select this value
#after doing this for 12 and 16 years school, we subtract the 16yr min wage from the 12yr min wage using echo and bp
